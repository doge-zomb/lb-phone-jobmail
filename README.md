# lb-phone-jobmail
This simple and customizable script enables the use of the LB-Phone SendMail exports to send email to players when they are Promoted/Demoted/Hired/Fired from their jobs in a qb-core server. This script is compatible only with qb-core and qb-management, however, it can be quickly changed to support other resources by the server developers.
